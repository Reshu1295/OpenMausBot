/**
 * Cool daylight — the fourth corner, and the one the grid was missing: Midnight is dark and cool, Atelier light and
 * warm, Foundry dark and warm. Where Atelier is paper, this is glazed ceramic. The neutrals carry a green- blue cast
 * rather than a cream one (#eef2f2, not #f5f1eb), so the whole surface reads cool without a single saturated pixel,
 * and the deep teal accent belongs to the ground instead of sitting on top of it. Even the ink is a very dark petrol
 * rather than a neutral black — on a tinted ground a truly neutral black reads as a foreign object. Corners are the
 * most generous of the four (8px / 14px): glass and ceramic round more than paper does, and far more than sheet
 * metal.
