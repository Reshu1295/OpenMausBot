/**
 * Night shift. The third corner of the grid: Midnight is dark and cool, Atelier light and warm — this one is dark
 * and warm, which is the register most of this app's actual use falls into. Its one structural idea, and the thing
 * that makes it read as metal rather than as "Atelier with the lights off": the accent is the brightest thing on
 * screen, not a darker patch of it. Brass at #d99a3e glows against the ground at 7.9:1 and carries near-black
 * lettering at 7.4:1 — so filled buttons read as lit, not as painted. That inversion is only possible because
 * --color-accent-ink exists; with hardcoded white text the accent would have to stay dark and the skin would lose
 * its point. Surfaces warm up as they rise (#100e0b → #262019), the way material does as it comes closer to the
 * lamp. Corners are tighter than Atelier's — 4px and 8px — because sheet metal doesn't round the way paper does.
