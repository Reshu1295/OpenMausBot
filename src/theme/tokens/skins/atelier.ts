/**
 * Daylight on paper, and the inverse of Midnight in every axis. Its one structural idea: surfaces get BRIGHTER as
 * they rise — rail, sidebar, content — so the ground closest to the work is the lightest, the opposite of a dark
 * skin where raised means lighter-grey. Four tones were darkened from the first draft to clear AA; the original
 * value is named next to each, so the drift stays auditable.
